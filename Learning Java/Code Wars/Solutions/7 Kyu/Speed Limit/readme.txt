Another Kata for me to try and learn java. Again there are similarities
between how I would write this in javascript vs java but they are mostly
in the pseudo code. In this I learned that I should include an argument
exception and create universial variable when they are unchanging.

The police have placed radars that will detect those vehicles that exceed the speed limit on that road. If the driver's speed is 10km/h to 19km/h above the speed limit, the fine will be 100 dollars, if it is exceeded by 20km/h to 29km/h the fine will be 250 dollars and if it is exceeded by more than 30km/h the fine will be 500 dollars.

You will be provided with the speed limits of those roads with radar as a collection of speedlimits [90,100,110,120,....] and the speed of the driver will be the same on all roads and can never be negative and the amount of the fine will be accumulated example 95km/h.

Example (Speed=100, Signals=[110,100,80]-> 250)
