========================Notes========================
This one took a while. I was getting myself lost in
terms of the bounding conditions, it was spinning
my brain in circles. Eventually I figures it out.
That was how I created the 1.0 version. The 2.0
version is my attempt at making my code modular and 
easier to read.
========================Notes========================
Given an n x n array, return the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.

array = [[1,2,3],
         [4,5,6],
         [7,8,9]]
snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
For better understanding, please follow the numbers of the next array consecutively:

array = [[1,2,3],
         [8,9,4],
         [7,6,5]]
snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
This image will illustrate things more clearly:


NOTE: The idea is not sort the elements from the lowest value to the highest; the idea is to traverse the 2-d array in a clockwise snailshell pattern.

NOTE 2: The 0x0 (empty matrix) is represented as en empty array inside an array [[]].
